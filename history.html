    <h2>🕰️ Ancient & Medieval Period</h2>
    <p>The history of Bangladesh goes back thousands of years. In ancient times, this land was part of powerful kingdoms such as Gangaridai, Maurya, Gupta, and Pala. Because of its fertile soil and rivers, the region became rich in agriculture and trade. Buddhism and Hinduism were widely practiced during this period.
From the 13th century, Muslim rulers came to Bengal, and Islam spread across the region. Bengal later became an important province under the Delhi Sultanate and then the Mughal Empire. During Mughal rule, Bengal was one of the richest regions in the world, famous for muslin cloth and trade.</p>

<h2>British Rule (1757–1947)</h2>
<p>
In 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, the British East India Company took control of Bengal. British rule caused economic exploitation, poverty, and famines, including the terrible Bengal Famine of 1943. During this time, many movements started to demand freedom and rights for the people.
</p>
<h2>
East Pakistan Period (1947–1971)
</h2>
<p>In 1947, British India was divided into India and Pakistan. Bangladesh became East Pakistan, even though it was far from West Pakistan. The people of East Pakistan faced discrimination in language, politics, and economy.

In 1952, the Language Movement took place to protect Bangla as a state language. Many students sacrificed their lives, and Bangla was finally recognized. This movement became a strong foundation for future independence.</p>
<h2>
🕊️ Liberation War & Independence (1971)
</h2>
<p>In 1971, after years of oppression, the people of Bangladesh started the Liberation War under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. After nine months of war and great sacrifice, Bangladesh became an independent country on 16 December 1971.</p>
